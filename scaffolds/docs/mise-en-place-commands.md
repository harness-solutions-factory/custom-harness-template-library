# Harness Template Library - Local Testing using Mise-en-Place
[<- Return to Harness Template Library - Developer's Guide](../README.md)

## Summary
This document details the available Mise-en-Place commands.  The goal is to simplify the various commands to rapid testing and prototyping.

## Prerequisites

This document assumes that your local development environment has followed the steps outline in the [Developer Environment Setup](../docs/local-developers-lab.md) guide.  Please review those requirements to ensure that you have all the tools necessary to proceed.

## Commands
_Note: a local list of available target commands can be printed by  running the command `mise help`_

| refresh | Refreshes the statefile | |
| output |  Display the Terraform/Tofu outputs | Supports returning a single output by providing that resource name as an argument|
